            <p><Stong>AGILE PROJECT: </Stong>Anis gained an understanding of the importance of the Agile Framework, as an iterative approach to software development, as well as a general approach in project management through a collaborative group project, spread across a duration of two days. The first day of the project was a theoretical introduction to the framework and helped Anis to understand the benefits of Agile in comparison to the traditional Waterfall framework, through an exploration of the Agile Manifesto, principles, and values. Focussing on the Scrum flavour of Agile, this consultant explored the various roles, ceremonies, and artefacts used in the implementation of the Scrum methodology. The second day of the project required a transfer of theoretical knowledge into a practical exercise to further enhance understanding. Working as a team in a Scrum simulation activity, the group was tasked to develop a product according to the requirements of a product owner. Following the initial task of translating these requirements into User Stories, as well as deciding on the Definition of Done, the activity throughout a series of iterations, utilised Scrum events such as sprint review and production of Scrum artefacts i.e. Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Burn Down Chart to organise the product development process. Moreover, using Retrospectives and Sprint Reviews, the team reflected on the values of team collaboration, continuous learning, as well as a customer-oriented approach, as vital principles of the Agile framework. Overall, the team successfully created a product that met the product owner’s requirements and expectations.
